# CSIR-research-capturing-
The Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAIR) is a virtual centre, hosted at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), and with nodes at a number of South African universities. The goal of this project is to create a web-based tool for managing the research outputs produced by CAIR members. The tool should enable users to: - add, modify, and delete entries corresponding to research outputs; - search entries based on various criteria; - produce reports based on the stored information. This functionality should be provided with appropriate levels of security built in
